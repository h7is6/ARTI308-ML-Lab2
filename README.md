# ARTI 308 – Machine Learning  
## Lab 1: Getting Started with Git and GitHub

---

## 📌 Lab Objective

The purpose of this lab was to learn the basics of:

- Git (Version Control System)
- GitHub (Cloud-based repository platform)
- Creating and managing repositories
- Branching and committing changes
- Creating and merging pull requests
- Uploading projects to GitHub

This lab was based on the official Git & GitHub tutorial manual.

## 🧠 Understanding Git and GitHub

### What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes in files over time.  
It allows developers to:

- Save project snapshots (commits)
- Track modifications
- Revert to previous versions
- Work safely without losing progress

---

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform built around Git.  
It allows users to:

- Store repositories online
- Share code with others
- Collaborate using pull requests
- Manage project history

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed in This Lab

### ✅ Task 1: Create a GitHub Account

- Created a personal GitHub account
- Verified email address
- Logged into GitHub platform

---

### ✅ Task 2: Create a New Repository

- Created a new repository
- Added a README file
- Selected repository visibility (Public)
- Provided repository name and description

---

### ✅ Task 3: Create a Branch

- Created a new branch from the main branch
- Used branching to safely make changes
- Understood that branches allow independent development

---

### ✅ Task 4: Make and Commit Changes

- Edited the README file
- Added text content
- Wrote a commit message
- Saved changes as a commit

A commit represents a snapshot of changes in the project.

---

### ✅ Task 5: Create a Pull Request

- Opened a pull request
- Compared changes between branches
- Added a title and description
- Submitted the pull request

Pull requests allow changes to be reviewed before merging.

---

### ✅ Task 6: Merge the Pull Request

- Merged changes into the main branch
- Confirmed merge
- Deleted the temporary branch

This completed the GitHub workflow cycle.

---

### ✅ Task 7: Upload a Project to GitHub

- Created a new repository
- Uploaded local project files
- Committed changes directly to the main branch

This allowed the project to be stored in the cloud.

---

## 🖥️ Tools Used

- GitHub (Web Interface)
- GitHub Desktop
- Visual Studio Code
- Anaconda (for Jupyter Notebooks)

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- README.md
- Project files
- Jupyter Notebook (if created)

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

Through this lab, I learned:

- How Git tracks changes
- How to create and manage branches
- How to commit changes with meaningful messages
- How pull requests work
- How to merge changes safely
- How to upload and manage projects on GitHub

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Lab 1 provided foundational knowledge of Git and GitHub.  
Understanding version control is essential for managing machine learning projects and collaborating with others.
